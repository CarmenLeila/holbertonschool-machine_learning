# ðŸ“ˆðŸ“Š Plotting

Plotting is the process of visualizing data or mathematical functions on a graph or chart. It helps to interpret data, observe patterns, understand relationships, and communicate insights in an intuitive way. Plotting is widely used in mathematics, science, engineering, and data analysis.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
General

- What is a plot?
- What is a scatter plot? line graph? bar graph? histogram?
- What is matplotlib?
- How to plot data with matplotlib
- How to label a plot
- How to scale an axis
- How to plot multiple sets of data at the same time

## Requirements
## General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.9)
- Your files will be executed with numpy (version 1.25.2) and matplotlib (version 3.8.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.11.1)
- All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
- Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to import any module
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
