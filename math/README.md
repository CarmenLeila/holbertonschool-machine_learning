## üìêüî¢ Linear Algebra

Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that studies vectors, vector spaces, and the linear transformations that operate on them. It provides the mathematical framework to model and analyze linear systems, and it is foundational to many areas of science, engineering, and computer science.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
General

- What is a vector?
- What is a matrix?
- What is a transpose?
- What is the shape of a matrix?
- What is an axis?
- What is a slice?
- How do you slice a vector/matrix?
- What are element-wise operations?
- How do you concatenate vectors/matrices?
- What is the dot product?
- What is matrix multiplication?
- What is Numpy?
- What is parallelization and why is it important?
- What is broadcasting?

## üìàüìä Plotting

Plotting is the process of visualizing data or mathematical functions on a graph or chart. It helps to interpret data, observe patterns, understand relationships, and communicate insights in an intuitive way. Plotting is widely used in mathematics, science, engineering, and data analysis.

- How to label a plot
- How to scale an axis
- How to plot multiple sets of data at the same time
